            <ul>
                <li>Scored 55 goals in 47 appearances, including a record-breaking 15 goals in the Champions League.</li>
                <li>Led Bayern Munich to a historic treble, winning the Bundesliga, DFB-Pokal, and the UEFA Champions League.</li>
                <li>Dominated domestic and international competitions, outshining all other contenders, including Messi and Ronaldo.</li>
